# @locio-au/vue

**Vue address autocomplete** for Australian addresses, with validation and
geocoding built in. Backed by G-NAF, the national address register.

- An accessible combobox you can drop in, or a headless composable if you have
  your own template
- Debounced and cancelled properly, so typing an address costs one request
  rather than thirteen
- Every result is already resolved: a stable G-NAF id, a coordinate, an ABS
  mesh block and the address split into fields. No second call to find out
  what was picked.
- Vue 3, no dependencies beyond it

```sh
npm install @locio-au/vue
```

## Quick start

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { AddressAutocomplete, addressId, type Address } from "@locio-au/vue";

function onSelect(address: Address) {
  console.log(address.formatted);
  console.log(addressId(address)); // store this, not the text
  console.log(address.lat, address.lng);
  console.log(address.components?.postcode);
}
</script>

<template>
  <AddressAutocomplete
    public-key="lc_pub_..."
    label="Delivery address"
    @select="onSelect"
  />
</template>
```

That is the whole integration. It handles the debounce, cancels superseded
requests, and implements the ARIA combobox pattern so arrow keys, Enter and
Escape all work.

`v-model` binds the typed text if you want it:

```vue
<AddressAutocomplete v-model="typed" public-key="lc_pub_..." @select="onSelect" />
```

## Use a public key

`lc_pub_...`, created at
[locio.com.au/account/api](https://locio.com.au/account/api). A public key
carries an **origin allow list**, so a copy lifted from your page does nothing
anywhere else.

Never put a secret key (`lc_live_...`) in a page. Anyone who opens it can read
the key and spend your quota. This package **throws at construction** if it
sees a secret key in a browser rather than letting it reach production working
perfectly.

For server code use [`locio`](https://pypi.org/project/locio/) (Python) or
[`locio-go`](https://github.com/locio-au/locio-go).

## Styling

The default styles are deliberately minimal. Replace them with your own class
names:

```vue
<AddressAutocomplete
  public-key="lc_pub_..."
  :class-names="{
    root: 'relative',
    input: 'w-full rounded-md border px-3 py-2',
    list: 'absolute z-10 w-full rounded-md border bg-white shadow',
    option: 'px-3 py-2 hover:bg-neutral-100',
    status: 'text-xs text-neutral-500',
  }"
/>
```

Or take the markup bare with `:styled="false"`.

## Headless

If you want your own template entirely, the composable has all the behaviour
and no opinion about the DOM:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { useAddressAutocomplete, addressId } from "@locio-au/vue";

const { term, results, status } = useAddressAutocomplete({
  publicKey: "lc_pub_...",
  debounceMs: 300,
  minLength: 3,
});
</script>

<template>
  <input v-model="term" />
  <span v-if="status === 'searching'">Searching…</span>
  <span v-else-if="status === 'empty'">No addresses match that yet.</span>
  <span v-else-if="status === 'unavailable'">Lookup is unavailable.</span>
  <ul>
    <li v-for="a in results" :key="addressId(a)">{{ a.formatted }}</li>
  </ul>
</template>
```

Writing to `term` is what drives it, so it drops straight onto `v-model`.

`status` is one value rather than several booleans, because "searching" and
"nothing found" being separately true is how a widget ends up claiming both.
Note that `empty` and `unavailable` are different states: a widget that
renders nothing for both tells the user neither, and an outage then looks
exactly like an address that does not exist.

## Address validation on its own

The client is exported if you want the other calls without the UI:

```ts
import { createClient, addressId } from "@locio-au/vue";

const locio = createClient({ publicKey: "lc_pub_..." });

const result = await locio.resolve("1 george st sydenham nsw 2044");
if (result.matched) {
  console.log(addressId(result.address!));
}
```

`search`, `resolve` and `get` cost one unit; `similar` costs three.

## Where your visitor is

A public key is scoped to the country the visitor is in, which the service
resolves from their own connection. Nothing in a page can widen that, and it
is why the key is safe to publish.

So a visitor in a country we hold no addresses for gets no results and a
sentence saying why, as an ordinary answer that costs nothing. Show that
sentence rather than your own "nothing matched" message, which was written for
somebody who has not typed enough yet:

```ts
const { results, status, note, countryCode } = useAddressAutocomplete({
  publicKey: "lc_pub_...",
});
// status === "empty" && note
//   -> "we hold no address data for NZ. Addresses are available for AU."
```

`<AddressAutocomplete />` already does this: when the service explains itself,
its message is the one shown. `searchScoped` and `similarScoped` on the client
return the same three things without the UI.

Australia is what is covered today.

## Which id to store

Read the id through `addressId(address)`. It is the address's id in its
country's register, and the one field every address carries:

| Field | Means |
|---|---|
| `id` | **This address.** The one to store. Read it through `addressId`. |
| `address_detail_pid` | The same id, under G-NAF's own column name. Australian addresses only. |
| `gnaf.primary_pid` | The **parcel** it sits on, when the row is a unit. Australian addresses only. |

An address outside Australia carries `id` and `country_code` and none of the
G-NAF fields: no pid, no `mesh_block`, no `gnaf` object. They are absent
rather than empty, because an empty one would say we hold something we do not.
Ids are unique within a country, so store `country_code` beside the id.

```ts
import { isUnit } from "@locio-au/vue";
```

Storing the primary pid stores the building rather than the door, and nothing
about the value itself says which you have.

## Props and events

| Prop | Default | |
|---|---|---|
| `publicKey` | — | Required. `lc_pub_...` |
| `label` | `"Address"` | Visible label, also names the suggestion list |
| `placeholder` | `"Start typing an address"` | |
| `debounceMs` | `300` | Quiet time before a request |
| `minLength` | `3` | Characters before anything is requested |
| `limit` | service default | How many candidates to ask for |
| `classNames` | — | `root`, `label`, `input`, `list`, `option`, `status` |
| `styled` | `true` | `false` for bare markup |
| `baseUrl` | `https://api.locio.com.au` | For a proxy of your own |

| Event | Payload |
|---|---|
| `select` | The picked `Address` |
| `update:modelValue` | The typed text |

## Accessibility

Implements the ARIA combobox pattern: `role="combobox"` with `aria-expanded`,
`aria-controls` and `aria-activedescendant`; a `role="listbox"` of
`role="option"`; arrow keys, Enter and Escape. The input is 16px, because
anything smaller makes iOS zoom the page on focus.
